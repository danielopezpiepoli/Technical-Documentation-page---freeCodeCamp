            Found a symphony orchestra as a platform for everyone to gain more orchestral practice and
have the opportunity to show their own talent, no matter their background or network, that
will allow the subsequent creation of derived symphony orchestras and other kind of
ensembles.

              At this moment, we are especially missing trombone players (0), horns (1), trumpets (1), and it would be nice to look for more bassoons, oboes, and violoncellos. Anyone who has a friend that might be interested, feel free to call them, also because it would be useful to have kind of a roster of substitutes.

              For the reason above explained, in the beginning there will be no principal or first chair for each section since the orchestra has yet to begin its activities. Therefore, each person will rotate this position in each repertoire until the orchestra is more consolidated and anyone can be appointed for that position.

              Classical: traditional concerts with full orchestra for standard repertoire and/or soloist
concerts, in theater halls or churches, as well as in other venues. This will be our main
repertoire, seeking a long-term basis project/orchestra.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arrangements of rock, pop, jazz, blues, movie soundtracks, national folklore (from everywhere): non-traditional concerts, in more open spaces and other kind of locations, but also in private concerts, depending on the occasion. This will always be included in our project, and the main purpose is to engage more and a different audience, that will always help us make our orchestra better known.
            </li>
            <li>
              Music works from new composers. This is intrinsically related to the vision of the project, which is giving opportunities to new talents.

            <li>Kultur Räume Berlin (Kulturraum Berlin gGmbH): It is a non-profit real state foundation supported by the local authority, which provides several rent subsidized venues across all the Berlin area for artists to rehearse and even perform in concerts. The average rate is about 5 € per hour for a maximum of 40 hours than can be booked every month.
              <p>Important notes: Had an online meeting on Thursday 11/01/2024, where it was explained that Kultur Räume Berlin has 2 mainly categories of venues: Kontingente and Studios. We are going to choose, at least in the beginning, the venues of Kontingente, for the following reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There is no need of a legal person (registered artist/association) to sign an initial contract for these temporary rentals. It is enough with a natural person, but in the future, it can be good to change or renew the contract with a legal person (the orchestra’s committee) that can be done when the time comes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kontingente’s venues, most of them equipped with chairs, stands, and some of them even with piano, are big enough to receive an orchestra and an audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  More information can be found on <a href="https://kulturraeume.berlin/en/">https://kulturraeume.berlin/en/</a>
                </li>  </br>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Churches and other kind of places. A directory with a lot of contacts was already created, and now it’s time to reach out to all of them, in order to have a back-up plan just in case the process with Kultur Räume Berlin takes more time than expected, but also to start having contact with potential locations that can be used for performances concerts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The day of the rehearsals (once in a week) has yet to be decided.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all the reasons explained above, the rehearsal venue may not always be the same, but we will do everything possible so that they are not too far from each other.

        <article>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Traditional concerts in theater halls, auditoriums, churches, and open spaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-traditional concerts with popular repertoire in open spaces, clubs, etc. In example: a candlelight concert or a flash mob.
            </li>
            <li>
              Festivals and competitions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Videos for Social Medias (a resource that must be used a lot) of rehearsals, concerts, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The idea is to have concerts, at least in the beginning, with no more than 2 months between each one, and gradually increasing to a concert every month. Every project will be different, and each repertoire may have more than one concert, depending on the chances we get, and every performance we add to our “orchestra’s CV” will be useful to get funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intention is to eventually have a calendar of the next scheduled concerts, and everyone to have access to the music score at least 2 months before the starts of rehearsals.

            <li>In case of interest to be part of the committee, or to help with other kind of additional tasks, please also send your non-musical CV (in case you have also worked in non-musical environments) and say what kind of task you would like to help with.
